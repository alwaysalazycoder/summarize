            <p>Who was this man who was staring at her so openly? She did her best to ignore him. She was feeling
                invincible now that she was married. It was like she was given the keys to her freedom. It had been a
                long time waiting. She knew Kiran next door all her life. For the most of that time, she never imagined
                being married to him. But now she feels free. Kiran wanted to go see this guru who lived by the beach.
                Kiran was so serious when he talked about him. he almost whispered. She could not understand such
                reverence. She was not going to let the reverence bother her. This trip was the first time she could get
                away from her parents and she wanted to experience life to the fullest. She sat on the beach, watching
                the sunset and she raised her water-bottle to her lips. The unfamiliar taste of alcohol was exciting as
                she sipped the vodka watching the sun set. She remembered the guy staring at her in the Guru’s Ashram.
                There was something about the intensity of his stare. It was exciting. She knew she was just married and
                should not feel this way. That only made it MORE exciting. Maybe she would see him again later in the
                evening. Even if she didn’t, she knew he was the tiger and she was on the safari. He would definitely
                see her. And to her, that mattered more. </p>
