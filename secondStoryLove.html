                “Don’t yawn like a caveman.” <br>
                
                Jane and Dave stood beneath the hazy blue sky. “Ah! The time and weather made me sleepy,” he looked towards her, “look at the sun rising behind the mountain." <br>
                
                “Damn! that’s a perfect blend of pretty and majestic,” Dave said poetically. <br>
                
                “Isn’t it ? I am so lucky that I get to see this with you,” Jane clutching Dave’s arm.  <br>
                
                “Me too babe, we dreamt of this day and it’s here, we made it and what a beautiful sight!” Dave put his head over Jane’s head. The fruity smell of her shampoo intoxicating him.  <br>
                
                “Look at those birds climbing uphill, it’s us... our journey to the top,” Jane strengthened her grip. <br>
                
                “I’m glad, we get to experience this view,” said Dave as he closed his eyes.  <br>
                
                An old man, listening to this couldn’t help doing a double take. Were they seeing what he was? It was a hillock. <br>
                
                “Are you guys on your honeymoon?” he asked. <br>
                
                “Yes! Just married sir!” <br>
                
                “We are on our 35th year,” he said. <br>
                
                “Oh how romantic. Was it hard?” <br>
                 
                “Oh, well, it’s uphill first. Then, after a few years, it’s all downhill.”  <br>
